# CCL-Mini-Project-Website

This website was made to be utilized for the 'Cloud Computing Lab' Mini Project. 
I used this website which was made using MySQL, PHP and Bootstrap.
The website was then hosted on AWS using their EC2 service.

#### Note!
This website was not created by any of our team members and is infact a template website which was acquired from the internet.
This was done on the suggestion of our lab instructor to save time. This free template was only used to test whether we were
successful in hosting a website on Amazon's AWS service. Upon learning of the source of this website, I shall add the link below..
